### 0% AKA NOW — “CAVA”

We are not waiting for sales goals or milestones to start the party!

We are working everyday to bring value to your wallet, your life, and your community. “CAVA” is our fancy, catchy, memorable acronym that outlines who we are and what we do.

### 50% Sold — Art Airdrops and Custom Cocktails

As part of “CAVA” we are (literally, right now, as I type) finalizing commissions and assembling an amazing collection of art to share with you.

This is the same collection we’ll be sharing on restaurant walls and in your wallet. The lounge/coffee shop/bar/gallery/ display program has begun in earnest, but at 50% sold we’ll start the airdrops. Along with the art we’ll be creating custom cocktails in honor of the collections/artists they represent.

There will be plenty of communication on the way so you’ll be prepared for any snapshot or deadline dates.



### 75% Sold — Luxury Bottle Raffles

As you may recall, there are 6 Luxury bottles available in the collection. Mint one and it’s all yours, have it mailed straight to your home — but that ain’t it!

**There are more chances to get your hands on a LUXURY BOTTLE 🍾**

To keep the party going we’ll be giving away exquisite bottles of wine curated by Grumpy Sommelier herself. After hitting the roadmap goal, we’ll raffle off a luxury bottle every month for a year. It’ll be one of these you see below, or something similar in terms of quality and prestige.



### 100% SOLD — Happy Hour

Web3, NFTs, Metaverse — this generation of technology is still in its infancy.

As a web3 social club, Grumpy Cantina plans to make waves and grow in the space — *as a holder, you get a voice on future initiatives*. Your vote will influence the direction of the club. New opportunities and new challenges will appear and we’ll continue to bridge the gap between web2 and web3.

Alongside these new initiatives, we will be fast-tracking the production of the Official Grumpy Cantina Wine Club Art Book which will include the volume GCWC art, cocktails, wine knowledge, and much more…
